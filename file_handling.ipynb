        "\n",
        "mßultithreading is useful in applications that involve multiple tasks that can run concurrently, especially for I/O-bound operations like file handling, network communication, and GUI applications. By using multiple threads, a program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for input/output operations to complete, improving overall responsiveness and efficiency. However, due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multithreading is not ideal for CPU-bound tasks, where multiprocessing is a better choice.\n",
